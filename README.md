# Repository Pattern With UnitOfWork MVC5

This project demonstrates the use of repository pattern with Unit of Work in Asp.NET MVC application. 

Note: In my opinion, a small project like this does not need any abstraction and should be kept simple. You should not use this pattern for the sake of using a pattern. 

Thank you.
